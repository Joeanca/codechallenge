Challenge mini program

start point: npm run dev
homepage: http://localhost:5001/
post to: localhost:5001/orders (more instructions on note_routes.js)

NOTES:
Node, Express, HTML and JavaScript used to create an application which aims to return an order accounting for dietary restrictions and the rating of the restaurant. 
Data was randomly generated for the restaurants to create a json file which is read into the program once fired up

A small API was designed, but has no connection with the html generator. notes on the notes_routes.js further explain future implementation.

Some sites were consulted and are noted where any credit is due.

Please forgive the rustiness of the code, I've been away from coding for at least 2 months and it shows. 

Jorge.
